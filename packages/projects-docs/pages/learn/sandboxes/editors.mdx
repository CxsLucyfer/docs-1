# Sandbox Editors

CodeSandbox offers two web editors and an iOS editor. A Sandbox is either a Browser Sandbox or a Cloud Sandbox (read more [here](/learn/sandboxes/overview)). All Sandboxes are available on the iOS app. 

CodeSandbox supports VS Code for [Cloud Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox) and [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

<Tabs tabs={["Browser", "Cloud"]}>

Browser sandboxes are sandboxes that fully run in the browser, and are made to run frontend JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks. If you would like to run backend services or databases, check Cloud Sandboxes.
    
## Synced Sandboxes
#### (previously called Repositories)

With CodeSandbox you can import any GitHub repository as a sandbox. An imported sandbox will
automatically stay in sync with the GitHub repository; if you make a commit to
GitHub it will reflect immediately in the sandbox.

For that reason we've made GitHub sandboxes immutable, this means that you
cannot make direct changes to the sandbox itself. They are treated as
[templates](/learn/sandboxes/templates), so you can fork from them. When you create a fork
of a GitHub sandbox we will still keep a reference to the original GitHub
repository.

## Uploading Static Files

It's sometimes desired to have either images or big files in a sandbox. We allow
you to upload these within CodeSandbox. As a
[patron](https://codesandbox.io/patron) you are allowed to upload a maximum of
500MB, otherwise you are able to upload 20MB. Remember that all uploaded files
are public, regardless of the privacy of the sandbox

<br/>
### Ways to upload
There are two ways to upload files: by using a wizard or by drag and dropping
the files in a folder in CodeSandbox. The wizard can be opened by clicking on
the upload icon in the Files tab.

Dragging and dropping the files in the Files tab works as well.

<br/>
### Storage Management

You can use an uploaded file in multiple sandboxes at the same time. For this
reason we have a separate 'Storage Management' that allows you to see which
files you have uploaded. You can find the manager in your user menu.

![Storage Management in User Menu](../images/storage-management-users.jpg?v2)

You are able to view your storage usage with the option to either open uploaded
files, add uploaded files to the opened sandbox or to delete an uploaded file.

### CLI Integration

When you deploy a sandbox using the CLI we automatically detect the binary files
and upload them to the CodeSandbox Storage Management after getting
confirmation.

Cloud sandboxes run inside a Firecracker MicroVM and utilise memory snapshotting to ensure fast fork time and wake up time. They can run anything that you would be able to run in your local environment, including Docker containers. You can learn more about how they work [here](/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds).

Cloud sandboxes are best used to run backend services, compiled languages and things like databases.

The Cloud Sandbox Editor contains a set of features to increase the accessibility of complex tools like git, setup, review flows, contributions, and visualizing components. 

Here is an overview of the editor structure:

### Header

The header is where you perform general operations on your Sandbox.

**1. Navigation**
    - **Sandbox**: Click to return to the dashboard.

**2. Devtool menu**
    - **Add Devtools**: Set up devtools to facilitate your work and automatize repetitive tasks.

**3. Connections**
    - **Avatars**: See who's currently online and click to follow their steps.

**4. Collaborate**
    - **Share**: Invite friends to work together.


### Sidebar

![The web editor](../images/overview-sidebar.jpg)

The sidebar is a quick way to operate and navigate your codebase. It allows you to:

- View and manipulate your files
- Search inside your project
- Interact with source control

You can change the sidebar view using the icons at the top.

    You can drag and drop elements and shift or command click to select multiple items in the lists.

### Code Editor

![The web editor](../images/overview-editor.jpg)

The code editor is where the magic happens ✨. We provide a base experience for all developers, with support for:

- Code formatting (Prettier or ESLint)
- LSP
- Intellisense
- Code completion
- Optimized syntax highlight
- Ligatures
- Multiple Editors
- Diff view

 If you want more advanced features, you can download our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects) and [open the Cloud Sandbox in your local IDE](../introduction/overview?tab=vs-code#keep-working-on-vs-code) with your own customizations.

### DevTool

CodeSandbox signature layout with three columns and a runnable preview is back with superpowers. The new panel on the right supports useful tools to help you complete your work faster and more efficiently. Read more about it [here](/learn/repositories/devtools).

### Layout

<Video src="../../overview-resize.mp4" />

Cloud Sandbox Editor allows you to customize the three-panel layout to maximize the space for the task you are working on. Hover the mouse near the edge of each column to see the resize cursor; click and hold to change the layout. 

After reaching the proportional limit, keep dragging to hide the entire column.
