# Toggle branch protection 

You can now toggle branch protection status for your projects in CodeSandbox. This works for both Cloud sandboxs and repositories.  

![Toggle setting](../images/toggle.png)

Main branches are protected by default to prevent unauthorized changes or accidental mistakes. However, you can change this setting for your project in the following steps:

1. Open Your project in the Web Editor 
2. Select Menu on the top left 
3. Select Project settings and click on Repository 
4. Toggle on or off

   	 If you unprotect your main branch, any changes would have to be committed to toggle the protection on again.
