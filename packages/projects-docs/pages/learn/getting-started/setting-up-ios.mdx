# Setting up iOS

## Getting Started

Bring your CodeSandbox projects with you wherever you go with just your iPhone or iPad. Simply download the CodeSandbox app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/codesandbox/id1423330822) and log in using your CodeSandbox account. If you don't have one yet, you can easily sign up using a GitHub, Google, or Apple account.

For the full CodeSandbox experience, we recommend linking your GitHub account. This will give you access to all of our features and capabilities.

### Select the Appropriate Workspace

Upon logging in, your personal workspace will be selected as the default. If you're part of a team, you can easily switch to your team's workspace by selecting it from the sidebar. On an iPhone, you can access the screen to switch workspaces by tapping the **Back** button located in the top left corner of the screen.

### Accessing Sandboxes and Repositories

If you are an existing CodeSandbox user and after selecting a workspace, you will be presented with a list of sandboxes and repositories that you have recently interacted with. To view all available sandboxes and repositories, simply navigate through the different categories in the sidebar or use the **Search** functionality available at the top of the screen.

### Creating a New Sandbox or Repository

You also have the option of starting from scratch by creating a new sandbox or importing a repository from GitHub.

#### Importing a Repository from GitHub

To import a repository from GitHub, simply tap on the **New Repository** button to start the import process. If you haven't already, you'll be prompted to link your CodeSandbox account with a GitHub account.

In the import screen, you can either enter the link to the GitHub repository you wish to import or select a repository from one of the GitHub organizations you belong to, including your personal GitHub organization. CodeSandbox will automatically create a fork in GitHub for repositories you do not have write permissions for.

#### Creating a Sandbox from a Template

Creating a new sandbox using one of the official templates is another option. It's a quick and easy way to get started with any technology without any setup required.

### Working with Local Sandboxes

With CodeSandbox for iOS, you can also create small Node.js prototypes locally. This is a useful feature when you're developing on your iOS device and don't have internet access. However, the functionality of these local sandboxes is limited due to restrictions imposed by the iOS operating system on applications available from the App Store.

For instance, local sandboxes are restricted to Node.js version 12, and any framework that relies on JIT compilation or WebAssembly won't work.
