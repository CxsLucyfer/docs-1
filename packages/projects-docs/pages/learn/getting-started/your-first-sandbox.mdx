# Getting Started with Sandboxes
Sandboxes are a great way to get working on your idea with zero startup costs.

CodeSandbox provides both [Cloud Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox) (powered by microVMs, so they're more powerful) and [Browser Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview) (powered by your browser, so they have more limits).

All CodeSandbox sandboxes are fully [collaborative](/learn/getting-started/collaborate-share?tab=browser-sandboxes).

<Tabs tabs={["Cloud", "Browser"]}>

## Using Cloud Templates
Cloud Sandboxes are an all-around great solution to help you prototype any app, regardless of the language you're using or the complexity of your project.

They have built-in [Docker support](/learn/environment/docker) and include several valuable features, such as collaborative [Terminals](/learn/repositories/terminal), [Tasks](/learn/repositories/task), and [VS Code integration](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-vscode).

<Callout>
Cloud sandboxes are built for scale. Our Free plan includes generous VM specs but you can easily [start a Pro trial](https://codesandbox.io/pro) to improve them.
</Callout>

One of the best things about our Cloud Sandboxes is that there are dozens of official templates you can use to start coding.
    
To get started, [open the `New` Modal](https://codesandbox.io/s/) and search through our selection of Cloud Sandbox Templates. You can recognize a Cloud Sandbox by their special _Cloud_ badges.

Templates are automatically forked when you select them, so you can edit
and begin creating your own sandbox.

## Opening a GitHub Repository as a Cloud Sandbox

Typically, whenever you want to run a GitHub repository in CodeSandbox, we recommend that you [import it](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-repository#create-a-team--import-a-repository) as a CodeSandbox Repository.

However, there are some cases where you might want to run a given repository (or a specific sub-folder of that repo) as a Cloud Sandbox. This is especially handy for large monorepos that include an `/examples` sub folder.

As an example, let's consider the [Blog example](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog) from the official Astro repository.

To easily run it as a Cloud Sandbox that's synced to the GitHub repo, simply update the URL in the address bar from:

`https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog`

To:

`https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog`

Then, you can easily fork that synced Cloud Sandbox and start prototyping.

## Growing a Cloud Sandbox into a Repository

When your prototype grows into a full project, you may want to add version control through git, to make updates and collaboration easier to manage.

CodeSandbox is specifically built to enable you to grow your project as big as you need.

You can scale your Cloud Sandbox into a Repository by navigating to the git menu on the left sidebar and clicking _Create Repository_.

## Programatically creating Cloud Sandboxes

If you want to use our API to create Cloud Sandboxes, refer to our [Define API](/learn/getting-started/your-first-sandbox?tab=browser#define-api) documentation and be sure to add an additional `environment: "server"` parameter to the request body.

## Finding Browser Sandbox Templates

The most popular way of creating a new Sandbox is the 'New' modal.

![new modal](../images/dashboard-new.jpg)

The **`New`** modal shows you collections of templates grouped first by relevance and then by broad category. This list is not comprehensive of all the Sandboxes that have been made by the community, however. If you want to browse other Sandboxes and Templates, you can explore everything in through the discover button at the top right of the dashboard sidebar.

Templates are automatically forked when you select them, so you can edit
and begin creating your own sandbox.
<br/>

### Using GitHubBox.com

An easy way to import a repo to CodeSandbox as a browser sandbox via URL is with GitHubBox.com.
Append 'box' to your github.com URL in between 'hub' and '.com' and it will
redirect to CodeSandbox.

Here's an example:

Change the GitHub URL:

`https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc`

To:

`https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc`

The result is we take the last part of the URL (everything after github.com) and
use it in our importer at `codesandbox.io/s/github/`, adding the repo to
CodeSandbox.

<Callout>
Unless you specifically want to use a Browser Sandbox, we recommend that you skip this method and instead import a GitHub repo as a [CodeSandbox Repository](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-repository#create-a-team--import-a-repository) or a [synced Cloud Sandbox](/learn/getting-started/your-first-sandbox#opening-a-github-repository-as-a-cloud-sandbox).
</Callout>

<br/>

### Using a Browser Extension

We have browser extensions for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-codesandbox/hdidglkcgdolpoijdckmafdnddjoglia)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/codesandbox/),
which add an 'Open in CodeSandbox' button to GitHub repo pages. This makes it
easy to import existing projects from GitHub in to CodeSandbox.

<br/>
### Setting inference

When importing, we infer sandbox settings based on several files in a
repository.

| Sandbox Setting | Inferred from                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title           | `name` field in `package.json`                                                                                                                        |
| Description     | `description` field in `package.json`                                                                                                                 |
| Tags            | `keywords` field in `package.json`                                                                                                                    |
| Template        | Based on [this](https://github.com/codesandbox-app/codesandbox-importers/blob/master/packages/import-utils/src/create-sandbox/templates.ts#L63) logic |

If the correct template isn't automatically being used when importing, then you
may specify a `template` property in your `./sandbox.config.json` file to
override the detected template.

```json
{
  "template": "node"
}
```
<br/>

## Import Local projects via CLI

You can import a local project into CodeSandbox by using our
[CLI](https://github.com/codesandbox-app/codesandbox-importers/tree/master/packages/cli).

To install our CLI, run `npm install -g codesandbox`. Then import a
project by running `codesandbox {directory}`.
<br/>

### Example usage

```
$ npm install -g codesandbox
$ codesandbox ./
```
<br/>

## Define API

We offer an API that allows you to programmatically create a sandbox. This is
useful for documentation, enabling you to generate a sandbox on the fly from
code examples. You can call the endpoint
`https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define` both with a `GET` and with a
`POST` request.
<br/>

### Supported Parameters

We currently support three extra parameters. The query accepts the same options
as the [embed options](/learn/sandboxes/embedding).

| Query Parameter | Description                                                                           | Example Input               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `parameters`    | Parameters used to define how the sandbox should be created.                          | Example below               |
| `query`         | The query that will be used in the redirect URL.                                      | `view=preview&runonclick=1` |
| `embed`         | Defines whether we should redirect to the embed instead of the editor.                        | `1`                         |
| `json`          | Instead of redirecting we will send a JSON response with `{"sandbox_id": sandboxId}`. | `1`                         |
<br/>

### How it works

The API only needs one argument: `files`. This argument contains the files that
will be contained in the sandbox.

An example body would be:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "index.js": {
      "content": "console.log('hello!')",
      "isBinary": false
    },
    "package.json": {
      "content": {
        "dependencies": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Binary Files

You can import binary files by setting `isBinary` to `true` and `content` as a
URL to the file hosted externally. For example:

```json
{
  "isBinary": true,
  "content": "https://..."
}
```
<br/>

#### Folders

You can create folders by naming the file with a `/` in its name, allowing you to
structure your application as you prefer:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": {
      "content": "console.log('hello!')",
      "isBinary": false
    },
    "package.json": {
      "content": {
        "dependencies": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will create a file called `index.js` in your `src` folder.
<br/>

#### Package.json

Every request **requires** a `package.json`. This file can either be a string or
an object. We determine all of the sandbox's information from the files, like we
do with the GitHub import.
<br/>

### GET Request

It's quite difficult to send the JSON parameters with a GET request. There is a chance
of unescaped characters and the URL hits its limit of ~2000 characters quickly.
That's why we first compress the files to a compressed `lz-string`. We offer a
utility function in the `codesandbox` dependency for this. The implementation
looks like this:

```js
import { getParameters } from 'codesandbox/lib/api/define';

const parameters = getParameters({
  files: {
    'index.js': {
      content: "console.log('hello')",
    },
    'package.json': {
      content: { dependencies: {} },
    },
  },
});

const url = `https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?parameters=${parameters}`;
```
<br/>

#### Example Sandbox

`https://codesandbox.io/s/6yznjvl7nw?editorsize=50&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&runonclick=1`
<br/>

### POST Form

You can do the exact same steps for a POST request, but instead of a URL, you'd
show a form. With a POST request, you can create bigger sandboxes.
<br/>

#### Example Sandbox

`https://codesandbox.io/s/qzlp7nw34q?editorsize=70&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&runonclick=1`
<br/>

### Define without render

If you want to define a new sandbox without getting it rendered, you can add
`?json=1` to the request. For instance,
`https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?json=1`. Instead of the render,
the result will be JSON data providing you with the `sandbox_id` of the new
sandbox.

This is useful, for instance, if you need to create a new sandbox
programmatically, so you can then embed it on your site (see
[Embed documentation](/learn/sandboxes/embedding)).

Both `GET` and `POST` requests are supported.
<br/>

### XHR Request

You can also create a sandbox using an XHR request, like using `fetch`. An
example sandbox is:

`https://codesandbox.io/s/9loovqj5oy?editorsize=70&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&runonclick=1`
<br/>

## Import Single Components

You can import a local component into CodeSandbox by using our other
[CLI](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandboxer/tree/master/packages/codesandboxer-fs).

You can install our CLI by running `npm install -g codesandboxer-fs`. Then you
can export a project by running `codesandboxer {filePath}`.

```
$ npm install -g codesandboxer-fs
$ codesandboxer docs/examples/my-single-component.js
```

This will print out the ID of a sandbox that does nothing but render the
targeted component, along with a link to that sandbox. This will also bundle in
other local files used by the component to ensure render.
<br/>

## Import Using Codesandboxer

[Codesandboxer](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandboxer) imports a single
file from a git repository, along with supplemental files and dependencies.

Using this creates an easy way to upload an example instead of an entire git
repository. This enables you to easily share examples with others, or to link to
editable versions of examples from a documentation website. React-codesandboxer
is the main version, but there are also versions for VS Code, Atom, and
BitBucket.
<br/>

### How it works

Below the surface, `react-codesandboxer` fetches the files it needs from GitHub or
BitBucket, using a single file that will be rendered as the 'example' as an
entry point, then uses the Define API to upload the necessary files into a new
`create-react-app` sandbox.

Check out the [codesandboxer docs](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandboxer)
for information on how to implement it.

```jsx harmony
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import CodeSandboxer from 'react-codesandboxer';

export default () => (
  <CodeSandboxer
    examplePath="examples/file.js"
    gitInfo={{
      account: 'noviny',
      repository: 'react-codesandboxer',
      host: 'github',
    }}
  >
    {() => <button type="submit">Upload to CodeSandbox</button>}
  </CodeSandboxer>
);
```
<br/>

## Import Using Remark-codesandbox

[Remark-codesandbox](https://github.com/kevin940726/remark-codesandbox) is a
remark plugin for creating sandboxes directly from code blocks in documentation.
Developed by CodeSandbox community member Kai Hao, it supports popular platforms
including MDX, Gatsby, Storybook Docs, docz etc. Learn more about it in their
[documentation](https://github.com/kevin940726/remark-codesandbox#remark-codesandbox).
