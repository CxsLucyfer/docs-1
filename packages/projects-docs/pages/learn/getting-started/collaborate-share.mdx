# Collaborate & Share
At CodeSandbox, we believe that collaborating on code should be as easy as possible.

As we evolve our platform, we keep expanding how you can collaborate with others when coding.

## Repositories & Cloud Sandboxes
 
CodeSandbox Repositories was built to facilitate collaboration.

Every branch you run on CodeSandbox gets its own live [development environment](/learn/environment/vm), which is fully collaborative by default. This means **you just have to share the URL of that branch to collaborate with others**.

When an Editor joins the branch you're on, you can follow their avatar through the code and do live pair programming. Terminals are also collaborative, allowing you to see the commands executed by other people working in your branch.

This makes CodeSandbox Repositories the perfect tool to develop full-stack apps with your team, as you can grant access to all projects and branches or share specific branches with more granular permissions.

### Sharing specific branches
1. Open the branch you wish to share in the **Editor**.
2. In the top right corner, click on **`Share`** .
3. Copy the URL to share your workspace.

### Working in teams
For more information on managing and creating teams, go to the [Team](/learn/teams/permissions) page.

### Working on other IDEs

Collaboration works on our VS Code extension and the CodeSandbox iOS App in a very similar fashion. Simply find the branch that you want to work on together, share the URL, and build together live.

### Cloud Sandboxes

Collaborating on Cloud Sandboxes is almost identical to what we described above for Repositories. The main difference is the fact that Cloud Sandboxes are an isolated instance that's not connected to GitHub, so there's no concept of a "branch".

### Live Sessions

#### What is Live?
All browser sandboxes on CodeSandbox are live, meaning you can share your sandbox with
others for real time collaboration on code. You can simultaneously create,
delete, edit and move files and code with others in a sandbox, as well as chat
about your changes. It's like Google Docs, but for coding.

#### Going Live
All browser sandboxes are collaborative by default. You can invite contributors to join the
sandbox using the `Share` button at the top right of the editor.

Browser Sandboxes also allow you to make your sandbox "Live" to the entire world, including users that you haven't directly invited to contribute on a sandbox.

Whenever Live mode is activated from the _Live_ tab on the activity bar, you get a Live URL to share with other CodeSandbox users so that they can immediately join you to collaborate live.

Live editors can only make edits to the sandbox while they are in the
session, they cannot do this when just viewing the sandbox.

Invited editors can simultaneously edit, create, rename and update files and
code, as well as add and remove dependencies. You can also see in real time
the files that other collaborators are looking at and any code that they select.

#### Classroom Mode
Classroom Mode is a specific mode of Live Sessions that allows you to define who can edit the sandbox. This is especially
useful when working with large groups. You will only see the cursors of the
users that have an 'editor' role.

You can enable Classroom Mode from the Live Mode drop-down menu.

You can give someone editor rights by pressing the '+' icon next to their name,
or make them a viewer by clicking the '-' icon next to their name.
